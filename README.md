# Project Title

Name Sorter assessment for Dye & Durham

## Assumptions

1. Can import a library and use its sort() method
2. Can set input and output file names with command line arguments (e.g., unsorted-names-list.txt, sorted-names-list.txt)
3. Arguments can be found in pom.xml. Assumed this was ok
4. Used Github Actions instead of travis because travis was not free. Assumed this was ok
